# Codershop

iOS app that uses table views and collection views to display imaginary store data. 
Data is stored locally and the goal for this project was to learn about layouts. 
Created following "Coder Swag" tutorial from Mark Price's iOS 11 & Swift 4 course. 
All assets except app icon provided by the course.
